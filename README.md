# ESC384-Partial-Differential-Equations

## Description
Matlab coding part of assignments of ESC384 (Fall 2019) at the University of Toronto. 

A1: Fourise sine and cosine series, and comparison with original functions.

A4: Implementation of a finite difference heat equation solver;
    Plot Laplace's equation in an annular domain. 

A5: Implementation of a finite difference wave equation solver on the L-shaped domain.

## Note
ONLY matlab codes are posted, ie: solutions to assignments are not. Sorry about that.

Only 3 out of 5 assignments contained matlab coding.

## Updata
Final aid sheet is uploaded. Some part was written in Chinese lol, and please zoom in to see my writing clearly. Sorry about that.
