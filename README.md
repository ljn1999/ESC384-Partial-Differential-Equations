# ESC384-Partial-Differential-Equations

# Description
Matlab coding part of assignments of ESC384 (Fall 2019) at the University of Toronto. 

ONLY matlab codes are posted, ie: solutions to assignments are not. Sorry about that.

Only 3 out of 5 assignments contained matlab coding.

A1: fourise sine and cosine series, and comparison with original functions.

A4: implementation of a finite difference heat equation solver.
    Plot Laplace's equation in an annular domain. 

A5: implementation of a finite difference wave equation solver on the L-shaped domain.

# Note
All csv files are in Data folder, they were downloaded from Yahoo finance.

xxx_next.csv is just a month later's data of xxx.csv. One csv file for one asset is actually enough.

Calculations of expected returns, standard deviations and co-variances were done in matlab.
